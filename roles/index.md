# Roles

The following are the descriptions, duties, and training for each of the defined roles in an incident response.

`TODO: Customize roles, descriptions, duties, and training, if necessary.`

## Structure of Roles

* Command Team
  * [Incident Commander](#role-incident-commander-ic)
  * [Deputy Incident Commander](#role-deputy-incident-commander-deputy)
  * [Scribe](#role-scribe)
* Liaison Team
  * Internal [Liaison](#role-liaison)
  * External Liaison
* Operations Team
  * [Subject Matter Experts](#role-subject-matter-expert-sme) (SMEs) for Systems
  * SMEs for Teams/Business Units
  * SMEs for Executive Functions (_e.g._, Legal, HR, Finance)
During larger complex incidents, the role structure may be adjusted to account for the creation of sub-teams. Read about how we handle [complex incidents](/before/complex_incidents.md) for more information.

This is a **flexible structure**: every role will not be filled by a different person for every incident. For example, in a small incident the Deputy might act as the Scribe and Internal Liaison. The structure is flexible and scales based on the incident.

## Wartime vs. Peacetime

On incident response calls ("wartime"), a different organizational structure overrides normal operations ("peacetime"):

* The Incident Commander is in charge. No matter their rank during peacetime, they are now the highest ranked individual on the call, higher than the CEO.
* Primary responders (folks acting as primary on-call for a team/service) are the highest ranked individuals for that service.
* Decisions will be made by the IC after consideration of the information presented. Once that decision is made, it is final.
* Riskier decisions can be made by the IC than would normally be considered during peacetime.
* The IC may go against a consensus decision. If a poll is done, and 9/10 people agree but 1 disagrees. The IC may choose the disagreement option despite a majority vote.  Even if you disagree, the IC's decision is final. During the call is not the time to argue with them.
* The IC may use language or behave in a way you find rude. This is wartime, and they need to do whatever it takes to resolve the situation, so sometimes rudeness occurs. This is not personal, and something you should be prepared to experience if you've never been in a wartime situation before.
* You may be asked to leave the call by the IC, or you may even be forcibly kicked off a call. It is at the IC's discretion to do this if they feel you are not providing useful input. Again, this is not personal and you should remember that wartime is different than peacetime.
