## Role: All Participants

### Description

All participants in an incident response have the responsibility to help resolve the incident according to the incident response plan, under the authority of the Incident Commander.

### Duties

#### Exhibit Call Etiquette

* Join both the call and chat.
* Keep background noise to a minimum.
* Keep your microphone muted until you have something to say.
* Identify yourself when you join the call; State your name and role (_e.g._, "I am the SME for team x").
* Speak up and speak clearly.
* Be direct and factual.
* Keep conversations/discussions short and to the point.
* Bring any concerns to the Incident Commander (IC) on the call.
* Respect time constraints given by the Incident Commander.
* If you join only one channel (call or chat), do not actively participate, as it causes disjoined communication.
* **Use clear terminology, and avoid acronyms or abbreviations. Clarity and accuracy is more important than brevity.**

##### Reference: Common Voice Procedure

Standard radio [voice procedure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_procedure#Words_in_voice_procedure) **is not required**, however you may hear certain terms (or need to use them yourself). Common phrases include:

* **Ack/Rog:** "I have received and understood"
* **Say Again:** "Repeat your last message"
* **Standby:** "Please wait a moment for the next response"
* **Wilco:** "Will comply"

**Do not** invent new abbreviations; favor being explicit over implicit.

#### Follow the Incident Commander

The Incident Commander (IC) is the leader of the incident response process.

* Follow instructions from the incident commander.
* Do not perform any actions unless the incident commander has told you to do so.
* The commander will typically poll for strong objections before tasking a large action. Raise objections if you have them.
* Once the commander has made a decision, follow that decision (even if you disagreed).
* Answer any questions the commander asks you in a clear and concise way.  Answering "I don't know" is acceptable. Do not guess.
* The commander may ask you to investigate something and get back to them in X minutes. Be ready with an answer within that time.  Asking for more time is acceptable, but provide the commander an estimate.
